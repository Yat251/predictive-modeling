# predictive-modeling

Overview
This project focuses on predicting the fatigue life of materials using various machine learning regression models. The objective was to implement, validate, and compare multiple models to identify the best-performing one. The project involved extensive feature engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to optimize the prediction accuracy.

Models Implemented
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Random Forest Regression
Neural Network
Among these, Random Forest was identified as the best-performing model with an accuracy of 89% in predicting fatigue life.

Feature Engineering
Pearson Correlation Matrix: Used to assess the correlation between features, which helped in selecting the most relevant features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted to understand the data distribution, identify outliers, and detect patterns that could improve model performance.
